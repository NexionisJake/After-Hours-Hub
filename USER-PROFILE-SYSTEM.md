# User Profile System Implementation

## Overview

The User Profile System creates a central identity hub for each user in the After Hours Hub application. This system builds trust, credibility, and increases user engagement by allowing users to view each other's public activity history.

## Features Implemented

### Phase 1: Profile Page (`profile.html`)
- **Profile Header**: Displays user's name and avatar (first letter of name)
- **Activity Statistics**: Shows counts for market listings, assignment requests, events, and lost & found items
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organized sections for different types of user activity
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

### Phase 2: Profile Logic (`profile.js`)
- **Dynamic User Loading**: Retrieves user ID from URL parameter (`?uid=userId`)
- **Multi-source Data Fetching**: Aggregates user data from all collections
- **Fallback User Info**: If no user document exists, extracts user info from their activity
- **Real-time Statistics**: Counts and displays user's activity across all modules

### Phase 3: Clickable User Names
Updated the following files to make user names clickable:
- `lost-and-found.js`: "Reported by" names link to profiles
- `hostel-market.js`: Seller names link to profiles  
- `assign-help.js`: Author names link to profiles
- `moderate-events.js`: Organizer names link to profiles

### Phase 4: Security & Database
- **Firestore Rules**: Added secure rules for the `users` collection
- **User Document Creation**: Automatic user document creation on login
- **Privacy Protection**: Only public information is accessible via profiles

## File Structure

```

```

## How It Works

### 1. User Document Creation
When users log in via Google Auth, a user document is automatically created in the `users` collection:

```javascript
{
  uid: "user123",
  displayName: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  photoURL: "https://...",
  lastLoginAt: timestamp,
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

### 2. Profile URL Structure
Profiles are accessed via: `profile.html?uid=userId`

### 3. Data Aggregation
The profile page queries multiple collections:
- `marketListings` where `sellerId == userId`
- `assignmentRequests` where `authorId == userId`  
- `events` where `submittedBy.uid == userId`
- `lostAndFoundItems` where `reportedBy.uid == userId`

### 4. Clickable Names
Throughout the app, user names are now wrapped in anchor tags:
```html
<a href="profile.html?uid=userId" class="user-link">John Doe</a>
```

## Security Considerations

### Firestore Rules
```javascript
match /users/{userId} {
  // Any signed-in user can read public user information
  allow read: if isSignedIn();
  
  // Only the user can create/update their own profile  
  allow create, update: if isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid == userId;
  
  // No deletion of user profiles
  allow delete: if false;
}
```

### Privacy Protection
- Only public activity is shown (market listings, events, etc.)
- Private data like chats and notifications remain protected
- Users cannot modify other users' profiles
- All data queries are read-only for profile viewers

## Styling

### User Link Styles
```css
.user-link {
  color: var(--secondary-accent);
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 500;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 2px 4px;
}

.user-link:hover {
  color: var(--primary-accent);
  background: rgba(108, 92, 231, 0.1);
  transform: translateY(-1px);
}
```

### Profile Page Layout
- **Header**: Gradient background with avatar and stats
- **Tabs**: Clean, rounded tab interface
- **Cards**: Consistent card design across all activity types
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for better UX
- **Empty States**: Friendly messages when users have no activity

## Benefits

### Trust & Credibility
- Users can see others' activity history
- Established users with successful transactions appear more trustworthy
- Transparent community interactions

### Increased Engagement  
- Users explore others' profiles and discover more content
- Cross-module discovery (finding events from market sellers)
- Stronger sense of community through user connections

### User Experience
- Consistent navigation from any user mention
- Comprehensive view of user activity
- Professional, polished interface

## Deployment

Run the deployment script to activate the system:
```powershell
.\deploy-profile-system.ps1
```

This will:
1. Deploy the updated Firestore security rules
2. Enable the users collection
3. Activate profile functionality across the app

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for future versions:
- User reputation scoring
- Profile customization options
- Activity timeline view
- User verification badges
- Social features (following/followers)
- User statistics and achievements
