# Firebase Analytics Cookie Fix

## Issue Description
Firebase Analytics was creating Google Analytics cookies (`_ga`, `_ga_0ZYV2HJNBE`) in development environment, causing browser errors about invalid domain configurations.

## Root Cause
The Firebase configuration included a `measurementId` which automatically triggers analytics initialization and cookie creation, even in local development environments where cookies can't be properly set for localhost domains.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Conditional Firebase Configuration (`firebase-config.js`)
- Added environment detection logic to determine if we're in production vs development
- Only include `measurementId` in the Firebase config when in production environment
- Development environments (localhost, 127.0.0.1, file://) get a config without analytics

### 2. Analytics Initialization (`firebase-auth.js`)
- Modified analytics initialization to only occur when `measurementId` is present in config
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Uses dynamic imports to only load analytics module when needed

### 3. Environment Detection Logic (CORRECTED)
```javascript
// FIXED: Only production when on actual Firebase hosting domains
const isProduction = window.location.hostname.includes('after-hours-hub.web.app') ||
                    window.location.hostname.includes('after-hours-hub.firebaseapp.com');
```

**Previous Logic Issue:** The original logic incorrectly detected localhost as production due to faulty negative logic.

**Fixed Logic:** Now explicitly checks for Firebase hosting domains only.

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates cookie domain errors in development
- ✅ Maintains full analytics functionality in production
- ✅ Improves development experience with cleaner console logs
- ✅ Reduces unnecessary network requests in development

## Files Modified
- `src/firebase-config.js` - Added conditional measurementId inclusion
- `src/firebase-auth.js` - Updated analytics initialization logic
- Multiple HTML files - Updated CSP headers to include `firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com`

## Testing
- Development: Analytics disabled, no cookie errors
- Production: Analytics enabled with full functionality
